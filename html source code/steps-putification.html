    <h1>Steps of purification we take...</h1>
    <p>Treatment of waste water involves physical, chemical and biological processes, which remove physical, chemical
        and biological
        matter that contaminates the wastewater.
    </p>
    <div>These are the steps we pass the waste water through:-</div>

                    Wastewater is passed through <a href="#bar screen">bar screens</a>. Large objects like rags, sticks,
                    cans, plastic packets,
                    napkins are removed. </li>

                <li>Water then goes to a <a href="#grit">grit and sand removal tank</a>. The speed of the incoming water
                    is decreased to
                    allow sand, grit and
                    pebbles to settle down.

                    faeces settle at
                    the bottom and are removed with a scraper. This is the <a href="#sludge treatment">sludge</a>. A
                    skimmer removes the floatable solids like oil and grease.
                    Water so cleared is called clarified water.

                    The water is then

    <p>The sludge is transferred into a seperate tank where:-
    <ol>
        <li>It is treated with anaerobic bacteria. </li>
        <li>The biogas produced in the process is used as fuel and also for producing electricity.</li>

    <a id="activated sludge">Activated sludge is about 97% water. The water is removed by sand drying beds or machines.
        Dried sludge is used as manure, returning
        organic matter and nutrients back to the soil.
