    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3><b>Expanding our plants to other parts of India</b></h3>
            <p style="background-color: beige;">Towards end of this year, we are already coming up with a new WWTP in
                Dombivali area of Mumbai.
                Furthermore, over a span of 4.5 years, our next WWTP will come up in Jodhpur. Within 15 years, we plan
                to
                have at least 7 base plants. That sounds a bit slow but several other projects are being hjandled by us
                in a
                parallel fashion. This is plannned on a sustainable basis as one not just builds new project but also
                has to
                maintain the standards of existing ones. Taking together the present, we plan to expand hygeinic waste
                water
                treatment tomorrow.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><b>Improving status of our dumping grounds</b></h3>
            <p style="background-color: blanchedalmond;">Currently, we rely on public dumping grounds that are already
                known. But there are better sites available
                that may be
                converted into dumping sites for wastewater and sewage. This, no doubt, requires steadiness; the biggest
                one
                is to
                satisfy the natives around. There are several slums whose condition is no good than a dumping ground
                itself.
                Getting the
                population shifted to a new location is tiring, and needs compensations. If these is somehow achieved,
                then
                we may find a dumping
                ground in our vicinity and that would bring down the cost of transportation of waste water significantly
                lower. The money
                saved could be used for other needful projects.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><b>Taking hands on <quote>Green</quote> projects too than only <quote>Blue</quote> projects.</b></h3>
            <p style="background-color: bisque;">The sensitivity over water conservation and protection is now well
                spread. but forest conservation
                still hasn't received much of the needed support. We plan to purchase some barren lands and practice
                organic
                methods to rebuilt
                fertility of those lands. This would require support from many governmental and non governmental
                organisations also.
                Purchasing lands is not easy. Subsidised land rates should be provided for such projects to undertake.
                If
                the expanse of land is
                wide, then after some years of treatment and care, it could be converted into a national park or
                biosphere
                reserve.</p>
