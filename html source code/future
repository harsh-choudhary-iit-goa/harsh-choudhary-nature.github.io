    <h2>Future projects we plan to undertake:-</h2>

            <h3>Expanding our plants to other parts of India</h3>
            Towards end of this year, we are already coming up with a new WWTP in Dombivali area of Mumbai.
            Furthermore, over a span of 4.5 years, our next WWTP will come up in Jodhpur. Within 15 years, we plan to
            have at least 7 base plants. That sounds a bit slow but several other projects are being hjandled by us in a
            parallel fashion. This is plannned on a sustainable basis as one not just builds new project but also has to
            maintain the standards of existing ones. Taking together the present, we plan to expand hygeinic waste water
            treatment tomorrow.

            <h3>Improving status of our dumping grounds</h3>
            Currently, we rely on public dumping grounds that are already known. But there are better sites available
            that may be
            converted into dumping sites for wastewater and sewage. This, no doubt, requires steadiness; the biggest one
            is to
            satisfy the natives around. There are several slums whose condition is no good than a dumping ground itself.
            Getting the
            population shifted to a new location is tiring, and needs compensations. If these is somehow achieved, then
            we may find a dumping
            ground in our vicinity and that would bring down the cost of transportation of waste water significantly
            lower. The money
            saved could be used for other needful projects.
        </li>

            <h3>Taking hands on <quote>Green</quote> projects too than only <quote>Blue</quote> projects.</h3>
            The sensitivity over water conservation and protection is now well spread. but forest conservation
            still hasn't received much of the needed support. We plan to purchase some barren lands and practice organic
            methods to rebuilt
            fertility of those lands. This would require support from many governmental and non governmental
            organisations also.
            Purchasing lands is not easy. Subsidised land rates should be provided for such projects to undertake. If
            the expanse of land is
            wide, then after some years of treatment and care, it could be converted into a national park or biosphere
            reserve.
