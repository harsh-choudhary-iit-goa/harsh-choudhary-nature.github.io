    <h1>Be a better citizen</h1>
    <p>Waste generation is the natural part of human activity. But we can limit the quality and quantity of waste
        produced.
        Become well informed citizens and follow these practices for a hygeinic lifestyle:-</p>
    <h2>Better house keeping practices</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Cooking oils and fats should not be thrown down the drain. </b> They can harden and block the pipes.
            In an
            open drain the fats clog the soil pores
            reducing its effectiveness in filtering
            water. Throw oil and fats in the
            dustbin.</li>
        <li><b>Chemicals like paints, solvents,
                insecticides, motor oil, medicines
                may kill microbes that help purify
                water. So do not throw them down
                the drain.</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>Used tealeaves, solid food remains,
                soft toys, cotton, sanitary towels, etc.
                should also be thrown in the dustbin. These wastes choke the
                drains.</b> They do not allow free flow
            of oxygen. This hampers the
            degradation process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sanitation and disease</h2>
    <p>Poor sanitation and contaminated
        drinking water is the cause of a large
        number of diseases.
        Let us look at our own country. A
        vast number of our people are still
        without sewerage facilities. Where do
        they relieve themselves?
        A very large fraction of our people
        defecates in the open, on dry riverbeds,
        on railway tracks, near fields and many
        a time directly in water. <b>Untreated
            human excreta is a health hazard. It
            may cause water pollution and soil
            pollution. Both the surface water and
            groundwater get polluted.</b> Groundwater
        is a source of water for wells, tubewells,
        springs and many rivers. Thus, it becomes the most
        common route for water borne diseases.
        They include
    <ul>
        <li>cholera</li>
        <li>typhoid</li>
        <li>polio</li>
        <li>meningitis</li>
        <li>hepatitis</li>
        <li>dysentery</li>
