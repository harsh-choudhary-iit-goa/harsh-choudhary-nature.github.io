    <p>Waste generation is the natural part of human activity. But we can limit the quality and quantity of waste
        produced.

        <li><b>Cooking oils and fats should not be thrown down the drain. </b> They can harden and block the pipes.
            In an
            open drain the fats clog the soil pores
            reducing its effectiveness in filtering
            water. Throw oil and fats in the

    <h2>Sanitation and disease</h2>
    <p>Poor sanitation and contaminated
        drinking water is the cause of a large
        number of diseases.
        Let us look at our own country. A
        vast number of our people are still
        without sewerage facilities. Where do
        they relieve themselves?
        A very large fraction of our people
        defecates in the open, on dry riverbeds,
        on railway tracks, near fields and many
        a time directly in water. <b>Untreated
            human excreta is a health hazard. It
            may cause water pollution and soil
            pollution. Both the surface water and
            groundwater get polluted.</b> Groundwater
        is a source of water for wells, tubewells,
        springs and many rivers. Thus, it becomes the most
        common route for water borne diseases.
